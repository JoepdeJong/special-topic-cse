## Install

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Price's model

An implementation of Price's can be found in `/models/prices_model.py`. The model accepts 5 parameters: 

- `n` the number of nodes in the generated graph.
- `m` the number of outgoing edges that a new node has.
- `k0` a parameter that ensures that citations are made. Usually `k0=`.
- `n0` the number of initial nodes in the graph.
- `reciprocal_threshold` or `p` the reciprocal threshold.

## Dataset

The dataset that is used in for the report can be found in the `/dataset` folder. The dataset is generated by `generate_dataset.py`. Information about the dataset and the computed measures for each graphs can be found in the `prices_model_seed1313_m3_k01_initial_nodes1.csv` file.

## Perturbations of the dataset

Perturbations are performed to test the robutsness of the graph in the dataset. 4 types of perturbations are implemented: node removal, edge addition, edge removal and edge reversal. The file `perturbation_loop.py` contains code to runs these perturbations on the whole dataset and stores all the measures of the perturbated graphs in the `/output` folder. All the resulting figures can be found in `/plots`. Also a parallel implementation is added in `perurbation_loop_parallel.py`.

## Quantum random walk

The implementation for the quantum random walk can be found in `/quantum-walk`.
